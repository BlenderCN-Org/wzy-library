Prisoner's Dilemma
contracts/regulations->changing payoff, changing incentitives.
1. change game into interaction
2. change payoff by education

###Formal Stuff: Ingredients of a game
####players
notation: i,j

####strategies: 
$s_i$ - a particular strategy of player i
$S_i$ - the set of possible strategies of player i
$S$ - a particular play of the game, **a strategy profile**

####payoffs
$U_i(s_1,...,s_n)$
$U_i(S)$

####one more notation
$S_{n-i}$ - choice for all except person "i" or player "i"
$U_{n-i}(S_1,...,S_n)$

player 1,2</br>
strategy set: $S_1$={T,B}, $S_2$={L,C,R}.</br>
payoffs: $U_1(T,C)$=11, $U_2(T,C)$=3.</br>
To player 2, C dominate R.

**Definition 1:** player i's strategy $S'_i$ __is strictly dominated__ by player i's strategy $S_i$ (if $S_i$ always does strictly better)</br>
$U_I(S_i,S_{-i})>U_I(S'_i,S'_{-i})$ for all $S_i$.

payoff:</br>
Attacker's payoff is how many battalions does he get to bring into your country.</br>
Defender's (you) payoff is how many battalions of attacker get distroyed.

	                attack 
	              Easy Hard 
	            ┌─────┬─────┐
	       Easy │ 1,1 │ 1,1 │
	defend      ├─────┼─────┤
	       Hard │ 0,2 │ 2,0 │
	            └─────┴─────┘

In this case, for attacker, easy path is weakly dominate hard path.

**Definition 2:** Player i's strategy $S'_i$ __is weakly dominated by__ her strategy $S_i$ if</br>
$U_i(S_i,S_{-i})\geq U_i(S'_i,S'_{-i})$ for all $S_i$,</br>
$U_i(S_i,S_{-i})> U_i(S'_i,S'_{-i})$ for some $S_i$.

###2/3 Average Game
"Without showing your neighbor what you are doing, put it in the box below a whole number between 1 and 100. We will calculated the average number chosen in the class and the winner of this game is the person who gets closest to two-thirds times the average number. They will win five dollars minus the difference in pennies."

####Analysis:
| Range | Describe | K&R |
|--------| ----- |------|
| $\gt$ 67 | dominated | rational player |
| 67$\ge S_i \gt $ 45 | not weakly dominated in original gmame. but weakly dominated once deletes strategy "in shoes" argument |rational and knowledge that other people are rational|
| 45$\ge S_i \gt $ 30 |... "in shoes in shoes"|R, KR, KKR|
| 30$\ge S_i \gt $ 20 |... "in shoes in shoes in shoes"|R, KR, KKR, KKKR|
